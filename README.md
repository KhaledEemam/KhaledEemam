## Hi there, I'm Khaled Emam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist. I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and possess a strong foundation in mathematics. I have a wide range of skill sets, which includes data analysis, data visualization, data modeling, machine learning, and deep learning using various techniques and tools. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to develop my skills and knowledge in the field. Below this intro, I have listed some of my projects and experiences for you to peruse.

## Deep Learning :

â€¢	**OCR** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/OCR)

Built an OCR app to detect and extract text from images using two main models: a Faster R-CNN for finding text regions and a TrOCR transformer for recognizing the text. I combined these models with an inference function for smooth text extraction. Set up a FastAPI endpoint for easy user interaction and used MongoDB (through Docker) to manage the images. The final model achieved an 7% Character Error Rate (CER).
Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, MongoDB, Docker

â€¢ **Image Caption Generator** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/image-caption-generator)

Developed an Image Caption Generator application using Python, Keras, NLTK, and OpenCV. Implemented VGG16 for image feature extraction and integrated Embedding and LSTM layers for text processing. Optimized model training with the Adam optimizer. Created a Flask-based API for generating image captions. The model was trained exclusively on the Flickr30k dataset, achieving a BLEU-2 score of 0.42.

â€¢ **Face Mask detection** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/face_mask_detection_YOLO7_CNN)

Developed a face mask detection system using both CNN and YOLOv7 models. The project involved two main phases:

1- CNN Model: Built and trained a CNN network on a dataset of face images transformed by cropping to isolate individual faces. Achieved an accuracy of 95.5%. Also implemented data augmentation techniques for improved generalization.

2- YOLOv7 Model: Converted PASCAL VOC labels to YOLO format and trained a YOLOv7 object detection model for face mask detection. Achieved an F1 score of 92%.

â€¢ **Dog breed Classifier** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Dog_breed_classifier_using_CNN)

The project aims to develop a CNN to classify dog breeds. It involves detecting if an image is of a dog or a human and predicting the breed for dogs or the closest breed for humans. Using models such as Custom CNN, pre-trained VGG-16 for dog detection and pre-trained ResNet-50 for breed classification. ( Python-Keras-Transfer learning-Classification).

â€¢	**Named Entity recognition project** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-)

Worked on a NER task using two approaches: one with the BI-LSTM-CRF model and the other with BERT, fine-tuning it. Achieved a 96% f1_score and made the model accessible by creating an API. Additionally, I developed a Dockerfile to simplify project dependency installation. Tech stack used (Python , Pytorch , FastAPI, Docker)

â€¢ **RAG project** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Simple-RAG-App)

This is a RAG app that processes PDFs into embeddings using an LLM, storing them in a Chroma vector database. Leveraged LangChain's stuff chain to retrieve answers by matching user questions with similar text chunks. (LLMs- LangChain)

â€¢ **Sentiment-Classification** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Sentiment-Classification)

Designed a Sentiment-Classification project using SpaCy, NLTK, Keras, and scikit-learn for text preprocessing and modeling. Got .84 accuracy with ML models, .847 with RNNs, and .91 with BERT fine-tuning. Independently designed and executed to classify sentences into positive, negative, and neutral categories, comparing performance across different machine learning approaches.

â€¢ **Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk** [(Project link)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/khalidemam/multi-class-prediction-of-obesity-risk)

Classified individuals into 7 categories (e.g., Obesity_Type_III, Normal_Weight) using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and sklearn for data visualization, statistical analysis, and feature engineering. Experimented using RandomForestClassifier, XGB Classifier, Neural Network, and Ensemble Learning, optimizing models with Optuna for 90% accuracy.
