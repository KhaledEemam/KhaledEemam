## Hi there, I'm Khaled Emam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist. I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and possess a strong foundation in mathematics. I have a wide range of skill sets, which includes data analysis, data visualization, data modeling, machine learning, and deep learning using various techniques and tools. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to develop my skills and knowledge in the field. Below this intro, I have listed some of my projects and experiences for you to peruse.

## Deep Learning :

â€¢ **Image Caption Generator** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/image-caption-generator)

In this project, I implemented a model that receives images from users and generates captions for them. The model was trained using the Flickr30k dataset

â€¢ **RAG app** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Simple-RAG-App)

This is a RAG app that processes PDFs into embeddings using an LLM, storing them in a Chroma vector database. Utilized LangChain's stuff chain to retrieve answers by matching user questions with similar text chunks. (llms- LangChain)

â€¢ **Sentiment-Classification** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Sentiment-Classification)

implemented text preprocessing and utilized several text representations, such as TF-IDF and word2vec. Additionally, I applied various approaches, including classical ML models, DL model and BERT fine-tuning. (NLP)

â€¢ **Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk** [(Project link)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/khalidemam/multi-class-prediction-of-obesity-risk)

A multi-class prediction project where i utilized data visualization, statistical analysis, and feature engineering techniques, followed by implementation of various machine learning models, with further fine-tuning using Optuna.

â€¢ **Dog breed Classifier** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Dog_breed_classifier_using_CNN)

Created a dogs breed classifier using transfer learning & haarcascades to identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, it will identify the resembling dog breed. (DL - Computer Vision -CNN â€“ Transfer learning- VGG)

â€¢ **Face Mask detection** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/face_mask_detection_YOLO7_CNN)

Applied custom training for YOLO 7  to be used to identify whether people are with mask , without mask or mask worn wrong. (DL - CNN- Classification)


## Data analysis & Machine Learning :

### Classification :

â€¢ **Churn Prediction Project** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Churn-Prediction)

Used a telecommunication company dataset to analyze the reason behind the customers churn and builded a ML model to predict if the customer will churn the company services or not. ( Data wrangling â€“ Data analysis â€“ Machine Learning) 

â€¢ **Finding donors** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/finding-donors)

This project applies supervised ML techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML identify groups of people that are most likely to donate to their cause.

### Regression :

â€¢ **Automobile Price Prediction** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/automobile_prices_prediction)

This project focuses on predicting the prices of automobiles using machine learning techniques. It involves importing the data, assessing its quality, identifying and resolving any issues, performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), training machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating the model's performance on testing data.

### Clustering :

â€¢ **Customer Segmentation** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/customers-segmentation)

Implemented Unsupervised Learning techniques to identify customer segments. (K-means Clustering , PCA)

## Data Analysis & reporting :

â€¢ **No-show Appointments Data Analysis** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Udacity_analyzing_no_show_appointments_data)

Used Numpy & Pandas to analyze doctor appointments data to figure the reason behind peopleâ€™s absence to their appointments

â€¢ **E-commerce A/B Testing** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/udacity_analyze_AB_Test_results)

Performed A/B testing on an e-commerce website to help in making decision whether by implementing this new page, keeping the old page.

â€¢ **Communicate data findings** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Udacity_Communicate_data-findings)

Implemented different Visualizations using seaborn to show the summary of findings.

## Data Visualization :

â€¢ **Sales Analysis interactive dashboard** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/sales_analysis_interactive_tableau)

Interactive dashboard visualizes different trends in sales through different states, payment methods and sales categories.

â€¢ **Netflix Shows Dashboard** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/netflix_dashboard_tableau)

Created a dashboard using Tableau to show different Visualizations for Netflix shows.

â€¢ **Pizza sales dashboard** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/pizza_sales_dashboard/tree/master)

The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the pizza place's sales and make data-driven decisions based on the analysis. (Power BI)

## SQL :

â€¢ **Investigating Chinook Database** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/chinook_database_sql_server)

Created database using SQL server and used queries to answer questions about it.

â€¢ **IPL Data Analysis Using SQL** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/exploring_IPL_database_with_SQL)

 Analyzed Indian Premier League data using SQL to find top run-scorers, wicket-takers, best economic bowlers and additional insights about the IPL database. (Data Analysis - SQL)

## ETL :

â€¢ **ETL Telecom Case Study** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/ETL-Telecom_Case_Study)

This is a project that involves Extracting, Transforming, and Loading (ETL) data from CSV files into a database. It provides a solution for storing and processing data related to customer transactions for a telecommunications company.

## Web Scraping :

â€¢	**Scraping Wuzzuf** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/web_scraping_wuzzuf-)

Created a script that asks the user to enter a keyword for a job to search for it in Wuzzuf, then it searches for all the available opportunities in it and returns CSV file contains all the required info about the offered jobs (BeautifulSoup- Selenium)

â€¢	**Scraping Google images** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/web_scraping_downloading_images)

Created a script that asks the users to enter a keyword for the item they want images for, then it asks them about the number of images they want, then the script takes control and downloads the images. (BeautifulSoup- Selenium)
