## Hi there, I'm Khaled Emam 👋

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer. I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and possess a strong foundation in mathematics. I have a deep understanding of various Machine Learning techniques and tools. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to develop my skills and knowledge in the field. Below this intro, I have listed some of my projects and experiences for you to peruse.

## Machine Learning :

### Classification :

• **Churn Prediction Project** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Churn-Prediction)

Used a telecommunication company dataset to analyze the reason behind the customers churn and builded a ML model to predict if the customer will churn the company services or not. ( Data wrangling – Data analysis – Machine Learning) 

• **Finding donors** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/finding-donors)

This project applies supervised ML techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML identify groups of people that are most likely to donate to their cause.

### Clustering :

• **Customer Segmentation** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/customers-segmentation)

Implemented Unsupervised Learning techniques to identify customer segments. (K-means Clustering , PCA)

## Deep Learning :

• **Image Caption Generator** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/image-caption-generator)

In this project, I implemented a model that receives images from users and generates captions for them. The model was trained using the Flickr30k dataset

### Computer Vision :

• **Dog breed Classifier** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Dog_breed_classifier_using_CNN)

Created a dogs breed classifier using transfer learning & haarcascades to identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, it will identify the resembling dog breed. (DL - Computer Vision -CNN – Transfer learning- VGG)

• **Face Mask detection** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/face_mask_detection_YOLO7_CNN)

Applied custom training for YOLO 7  to be used to identify whether people are with mask , without mask or mask worn wrong. (DL - CNN- Classification)

## Data Analysis & reporting :

• **No-show Appointments Data Analysis** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Udacity_analyzing_no_show_appointments_data)

Used Numpy & Pandas to analyze doctor appointments data to figure the reason behind people’s absence to their appointments

• **E-commerce A/B Testing** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/udacity_analyze_AB_Test_results)

Performed A/B testing on an e-commerce website to help in making decision whether by implementing this new page, keeping the old page.

• **Communicate data findings** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/Udacity_Communicate_data-findings)

Implemented different Visualizations using seaborn to show the summary of findings.

## Tableau :

• **Sales Analysis interactive dashboard** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/sales_analysis_interactive_tableau)

Interactive dashboard visualizes different trends in sales through different states, payment methods and sales categories.

• **Netflix Shows Dashboard** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/netflix_dashboard_tableau)

Created a dashboard using Tableau to show different Visualizations for Netflix shows.

## SQL :

• **Investigating Chinook Database** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/chinook_database_sql_server)

Created database using SQL server and used queries to answer questions about it.

• **IPL Data Analysis Using SQL** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/exploring_IPL_database_with_SQL)

 Analyzed Indian Premier League data using SQL to find top run-scorers, wicket-takers, best economic bowlers and additional insights about the IPL database. (Data Analysis - SQL)

## Web Scraping :

•	**Scraping Wuzzuf** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/web_scraping_wuzzuf-)

Created a script that asks the user to enter a keyword for a job to search for it in Wuzzuf, then it searches for all the available opportunities in it and returns CSV file contains all the required info about the offered jobs (BeautifulSoup- Selenium)

•	**Scraping Google images** [(Project link)](https://github.com/KhaledEemam/web_scraping_downloading_images)

Created a script that asks the users to enter a keyword for the item they want images for, then it asks them about the number of images they want, then the script takes control and downloads the images. (BeautifulSoup- Selenium)
